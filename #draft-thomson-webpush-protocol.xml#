    <abstract>
      <t>
        A simple protocol for the delivery of realtime events to user agents is
        described.  This scheme uses HTTP/2 server push.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Many applications on mobile and embedded devices require continuous
        access to network communications so that real-time events - such as
        incoming calls or messages - can be delivered (or "pushed") in a timely
        fashion. These devices typically have limited power reserves, so finding
        more efficient ways to serve application requirements greatly benefits
        the application ecosystem.
      </t>
      <t>
        One significant contributor to power usage is the radio.  Radio
        communications consume a significant portion of the energy budget
        on a wireless device.
      </t>
      <t>
        Uncoordinated use of persistent connections or sessions from multiple
        applications can contribute to unnecessary use of the device radio,
        since each independent session independently incurs overheads.  In
        particular, keep alive traffic used to ensure that middleboxes do not
        prematurely time out sessions, can result in significant waste.
        Maintenance traffic tends to dominate over the long term, since events
        are relatively rare.
      </t>
      <t>
        Consolidating all real-time events into a single session ensures more
        efficient use of network and radio resources.  A single service
        consolidates all events, distributing those events to applications as
        they arrive.  This requires just one session, avoiding duplicated
        overhead costs.
      </t>
      <t>
        The <xref target="API">W3C Web Push API</xref> describes an API that
        enables the use of a consolidated push service from web applications.
        This expands on that work by describing a protocol that can be used to:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            request the delivery of a push message to a user agent,
          </t>
          <t>
            create new push message delivery subscriptions, and
          </t>
          <t>
            monitor for new push messages.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Requesting the delivery of events is particularly important for the Web
        Push API.  The subscription, management and monitoring functions are
        currently fulfilled by proprietary protocols; these are adequate, but do
        not offer any of the advantages that standardization affords.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document intentionally does not describe how a push service is
        discovered.  Discovery of push services is left for future efforts, if
        it turns out to be necessary at all.  User agents are expected to be
        configured with a URL for a push service.
      </t>

        <t>
          In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
          document falls back on established shorthands for expressing
          interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
          words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these is
          described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          This document defines the following terms:
          <list style="hanging">

              Both the sender and ultimate consumer of push messages.  Many

      <t>
        At the very beginning of the process, a new  message subscription is
        created by the user agent and then distributed to its application
        server. This subscription is the basis of all future interactions between
        the actors.
      </t>
      <t>
        To offer more control for authorization, a message subscription is
        modeled as two resources with different capabilities:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A subscription resource is used to receive messages from a
            subscription and to delete a subscription. It is private to the user
            agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            A push resource is used to send messages to a subscription. It is
            public and shared by the the user agent with its application server.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        It is expected that a unique subscription will be provided to each
        application; however, there are no inherent cardinality constraints in
        the protocol.  Multiple subscriptions might be created for the same
        application, or multiple applications could use the same subscription.
        Note however that sharing subscriptions has security and privacy
        implications.
      </t>
      <t>
        Subscriptions have a limited lifetime.  They can also be terminated by
        either the push service or user agent at any time. User agents and
        application servers must be prepared to manage changes in subscription
        state.

      <section anchor="ttl" title="Push Message Time-To-Live">
        <t>
          A push service can improve the reliability of push message delivery
          considerably by storing push messages for a period.  User agents are
          often only intermittently connected, and so benefit from having short
          term message storage at the push service.
        </t>
        <t>
          Delaying delivery might also be used to batch communication with the
          user agent, thereby conserving radio resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          Some push messages are not useful once a certain period of time
          elapses.  Delivery of messages after they have ceased to be relevant
          is wasteful.  For example, if the push message contains a call
          notification, receiving a message after the caller has abandoned the
          call is of no value; the application at the user agent is forced to
          suppress the message so that it does not generate a useless alert.
        </t>
        <t>
          An application server can use the TTL header field to limit the time
          that a push message is retained by a push service.  The TTL header
          field contains a value in seconds that describes how long a push
          message is retained by the push service.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork type="abnf"><![CDATA[
TTL = 1*DIGIT
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          Once the TTL period elapses, the push service MUST remove the push
          message and cease any attempt to deliver it to the user agent.  A push
          service might retain values for a short duration after the TTL period
          to account for time accounting errors in processing.  For instance,
          distributing a push message within a server cluster might accrue
          errors due to clock variation, or processing and transit delays.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service is not obligated to account for time spent by the
          application server in sending a push message to the push service, or
          delays incurred while sending a push message to the user agent.  An
          application server needs to account for transit delays in selecting a
          TTL header field value.
        </t>
        <t>
          Absence of the TTL header field is interpreted as equivalent to a zero
          value.  Push messages with a zero TTL indicate that storage is not

        A push service is likely to have to maintain a very large number of open

          A server that wishes to redistribute load can do so using alternative

      <section anchor="storage" title="Push Message Expiration">
        <t>
          Storage of push messages based on the TTL header field comprises a
          potentially significant amount of storage for a push service.  A push
          service is not obligated to store messages indefinitely.  A push
          service is able to indicate how long it intends to retain a message to
          an application server using the TTL header field (see <xref
          target="ttl"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          A user agent that does not actively monitor for push messages will not
          receive messages that expire during that interval.
        </t>
        <t>
          Push messages that are stored and not delivered to a user agent are
          delivered when the user agent recommences monitoring.  Stored push
          messages SHOULD include a Last-Modified header field (see Section 2.2
          of <xref target="RFC7232"/>) indicating when delivery was requested by
          an application server.
        </t>
        <t>
          A GET request to a "subscription" resource that has only expired
          messages results in response as though no push message were ever sent.
        </t>
        <t>
          Push services might need to limit the size and number of stored push
          messages to avoid overloading.  In addition to using the 413 (Payload
          Too Large) status code for too large push messages, a push service MAY
          expire push messages prior to any advertised expiration time.  A push
          service can reduce the impact push message retention by reducing the
          time-to-live of push messages. <!-- TODO note the need to advertise a
          lower bound on this reduction when we get to TTL guarantees -->
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="delete" title="Subscription Expiration">
        <t>
          In some cases, it may be necessary to terminate subscriptions so that
          they can be refreshed.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service might choose to set a fixed expiration time.  If a
          resource has a known expiration time, expiration information is
          included in responses to requests that create the resource, or in
          requests that retrieve a representation of the resource.
        </t>
        <t>
          Expiration is indicated using either the Expires header field, or by
          setting a "max-age" parameter on a Cache-Control header field (see
          <xref target="RFC7234"/>).  The Cache-Control header field MUST also
          include the "private" directive.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service can remove a subscription at any time. If a user agent
          has an outstanding request to a "subscription" resource (see <xref

          status code, such as 410 (Gone).
        </t>
        <t>
          A user agent can request that a subscription be removed by sending a
          DELETE request to its private "subscription" URI.
        </t>
        <t>
          A push service MUST return a 400-series status code, such as 404 (Not
          Found) or 410 (Gone) if an application server attempts to send a push
          message to a removed or expired subscription.

      <section title="Implications for Application Reliability">
        <t>
          A push server that does not support reliable delivery over
          intermittent network connections or failing applications on devices,
          forces the device to acknowledge receipt directly to the application
          server, incurring additional power drain in order to establish
          (usually secure) connections to the individual application servers.
        </t>
        <t>
          While reliability is not required for messages that expire in few
          seconds (e.g. an incoming call) or collapsible ones (e.g. the current
          number of unread emails), it is more important when messages contain
          information that is longer lasting, e.g. a command to update a
          configuration value, or the acknowledgement of a financial transaction
          or workflow step. In particular, in the case of power-constrained
          devices, it is preferable to transmit the actual information in the
          “pushed” message reliably, instead of forcing them to reconnect
          periodically to get the current state.
        </t>
        <t>
          The availability of push message delivery receipts in the protocol
          ensures that the application developer is not tempted to create
          alternative mechanisms for message delivery in case the push service
          fails to deliver a critical message. Setting up a polling mechanism or
          a backup messaging channel in order to compensate for these
          shortcomings negates almost all of the advantages a push service
          provides.

    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        This protocol MUST use <xref target="RFC2818">HTTP over TLS</xref>; this
        includes any communications between user agent and push service, plus
        communications between the application and the push service.  Thus, all
        URIs use the "https" scheme.  This provides confidentiality and
        integrity protection for subscriptions and push messages from external
        parties.
      </t>

      <section title="Confidentiality from Push Service Access">
        <t>
          The protection afforded by TLS does not protect content from the push
          service.  Without additional safeguards, a push service is able to see
          and modify the content of the messages.
        </t>
        <t>
          Applications are able to provide additional confidentiality, integrity
          or authentication mechanisms within the push message itself.  The
          application server sending the push message and the application on the
          user agent that receives it are frequently just different instances of
          the same application, so no standardized protocol is needed to
          establish a proper security context.  The process of providing the
          application server with subscription information provides a convenient
          medium for key agreement.
        </t>
        <t>
          <!-- Scrub references to specific API(s) -->
          The Web Push API codifies this practice by requiring that each push
          subscription created by the browser be bound to a browser generated
          encryption key.  Pushed messages are authenticated and decrypted by
          the browser before delivery to applications.  This scheme ensures that
          the push service is unable to examine the contents of push messages.
        </t>
        <t>
          The public key for a subscription ensures that applications using that
          subscription can identify messages from unknown sources and discard
          them.  This depends on the public key only being disclosed to entities
          that are authorized to send messages on the channel.  The push server
          does not require access to this public key.
        </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Privacy Considerations">
       <t>
         Push message confidentiality does not ensure that the identity of who
         is communicating and when they are communicating is protected.
         However, the amount of information that is exposed can be limited.
       </t>
       <t>
         The URIs provided for "push" resources MUST NOT provide any basis to
         correlate communications for a given user agent.  It MUST NOT be
         possible to correlate any two "push" URIs based solely on their
         contents.  This allows a user agent to control correlation across
         different applications, or over time.
       </t>
       <t>
         Similarly, the URIs provided by the push service to identify a push
         message MUST NOT provide any information that allows for correlation
         across subscriptions.  Push message URIs for the same subscription MAY
         contain information that would allow correlation with the associated
         subscription or other push messages for that subscription.
       </t>
       <t>
         User and device information MUST NOT be exposed through a "push" or
         push message URI.
       </t>
       <t>
         In addition, "push" URIs established by the same user agent or push
         message URIs for the same subscription MUST NOT include any information
         that allows them to be correlated with the user agent.

             large.  A "push" URI necessarily identifies a push service or
             a single server instance.  It is also possible that traffic

     <section title="Authorization">
       <t>
         This protocol does not define how a push service establishes whether a
         user agent is permitted to create a subscription, or whether push
         messages can be delivered to the user agent.  A push service MAY choose
         to authorize requests based on any HTTP-compatible authorization method
         available, of which there are numerous options.  The authorization
         process and any associated credentials are expected to be configured in
         the user agent along with the URI for the "push service".
       </t>
       <t>
         Authorization is managed using "subscription", "push", "receipt
         subscription", and "receipt subscribe" capability URLs (see
         <xref target="CAP-URI"/>).  A capability URL grants access to a
         resource based solely on knowledge of the URL.
       </t>
       <t>
         Capability URLs are used for their "easy onward sharing" and "easy
         client API" properties. These make it possible to avoid relying on
         relationships between push services and application servers, with the
         protocols necessary to build and support those relationships.
        </t>
        <t>
         A "subscription", "push", "receipt subscription", "receipt subscribe",
         or push message URI acts as a bearer token.  Knowledge of a
         "subscription" URI implies authorization to either receive push
         messages or delete the subscription. Knowledge of a "push" URI implies
         authorization to send push messages.  Knowledge of a "receipt
         subscription" URI implies authorization to receive push receipts.
         Knowledge of a "receipt subscribe" URI implies authorization to create
         subscriptions for receipts. Knowledge of a push message URI allows for
         reading and acknowledging that specific message.
        </t>
        <t>
         Encoding a large amount of random entropy (at least 120 bits) in the
         path component ensures that it is difficult to successfully guess a
         valid capability URL.

     </section>

     <section title="Denial of Service Considerations">
       <t>
         Discarding unwanted messages at the user agent based on message
         authentication doesn't protect against a denial of service attack on
         the user agent.  Even a relatively small volume of push messages can
         cause battery-powered devices to exhaust power reserves.
       </t>
       <t>
         An application can limit where valid push messages can originate by
         limiting the distribution of "push" URIs to authorized entities.
         Ensuring that "push" URIs are hard to guess ensures that only
         application servers that have been given a "push" URI can use it.
       </t>
       <t>
         A malicious application with a valid "push" URI could use the greater
         resources of a push service to mount a denial of service attack on a
         user agent.  Push services SHOULD limit the rate at which push messages
         are sent to individual user agents.  A push service or user agent MAY
         <xref target="delete">terminate subscriptions</xref> that receive too
         many push messages.
       </t>
       <t>
         End-to-end confidentiality mechanisms, such as those in <xref
         target="API"/>, prevent an entity with a valid "subscription" URI from
         learning the contents of push messages.  Push messages that are not
         successfully authenticated will not be delivered by the API, but this
         can present a denial of service risk.
       </t>
       <t>
         Conversely, a push service is also able to deny service to user agents.
         Intentional failure to deliver messages is difficult to distinguish
         from faults, which might occur due to transient network errors,
         interruptions in user agent availability, or genuine service outages.
       </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Logging Risks">
       <t>
         Server request logs can reveal subscription-related URIs. Acquiring a
         "subscription" URI enables the receipt of messages or deletion of the
         subscription. Acquiring a "push" URI permits the sending of push
         messages.  Logging could also reveal relationships between different
         subscription-related URIs for the same user agent.  Encrypted message
         contents are not revealed to the push service.
